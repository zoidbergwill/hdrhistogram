# Contributing to HDRHistogram

Inspired by [Contributing to Go](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

HDRHistogram is an open source project.

It is the work of hundreds of contributors. We appreciate your help!

## Filing issues

When [filing an issue](hhttps://github.com/zoidbergwill/hdrhistogram/issues/new), make sure to answer these five questions:

1.  What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
1.  What did you do?
1.  What did you expect to see?
1.  What did you see instead?

General questions can go into issues too. Feel free to ask away!
